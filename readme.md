A game put together with the aim of being a text based RPG. This is a class project with a group, utilizing GitHub for collaboration. I will most likely take on this as a personal project in the future also.

I hope to further this project in time and extend it towards a fully featured text based RPG with an integrated scripting system and a matured API to fully script the game. This may take the direction into an engine for text based RPGs.
